## About Me

<img src="/images/ShufanAERA.jpg" class="floatpic" width="568" height="426" >



I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in **Educational technology** at the Virtual learning lab in School of Educational Information Technology, Central China Normal University (CCNU). My research interet includes Augmened Realityï¼ˆARï¼‰/Virtual Reality (VR) based learning, Embodied cognition, and Game based learning. 

I have been involved in research projects on various domains, including AR/VR based experiments, as well as the digitialization and preservation of musical culture. My focus encompasses both the **technological** and **cognitive** aspects. On the technological level, I am interested in creating serious games, virtual experiments, and HCI applications. On the cognitive front, I am keen to understand how these virtual manipulatives effect on students' knowledge, emotion, and behavior.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at  *[yushufan1993@gmail.com](mailto:yushufan1993@gmail.com)*

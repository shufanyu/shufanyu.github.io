#### 1️⃣ Circuit experiment (dissertation work)  <img src="/images/icons/ARicon.png"  width="20" height="20">

My dissertation work revolves around creating an AR-based circuit experiment designed to **enhance students' embodied interaction**, offering an improvement over existing virtual circuit platforms.

The key technological challenges addressed included: <font color="#A13232">accurate representation and calculation of circuit components, visualization of current flow, automated circuit diagram drawing, and real-time feedback for operational errors.</font>

At the educational level, I conducted a 2x2 pre-post experiment in a junior high school. The two variables I focused on were the level of embodiment (low and high) and the presence of external representation (whether the application includes visualization information).

The findings of this research will be released soon.

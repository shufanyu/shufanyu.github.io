#### 1️⃣ Circuit experiment (Ongoing research)  <img src="/images/icons/ARicon.png"  width="20" height="20">

This research is my dissertation work. I aimed to create an AR-based circuit experiment which can **facilitate students’ embodied interaction** compared to existing virtual circuit platform. 

The key technology issues needed to address were: <font color="#A13232">the representation and calculation of circuit component, the visualization of current direction, the automatic drawing of circuit graph.</font>

On educational level, I conducted a 2*2 pre-post experiment in a junior high school. The two factors I focused are embodiment and the external representation.

Findings will be released soon.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Haptic Titration 
This work was part of my participation in the Embodied Games Lab at ASU. In this research, we introduced a haptic mixed reality (MR) device designed for conducting titration experiments. **The device mimics the shape of an actual burette and includes an adjustable stopcock.** Students can turn the stopcock, and the computer will display the drops of solution in real time, corresponding to the degree of turning.

In this study, we investigated the effects of haptic titration compared to a keyboard-based version, recording students' self-reflections on the experiment. My primary focus was on the knowledge units and the gestures students demonstrated. An epistemic network analysis (ENA) was conducted, and the results showed that **<u><font color="#A13232">students in the haptic titration group demonstrated more connections between gestures (particularly the stopcock turning gesture) and idea units</font></u>**.

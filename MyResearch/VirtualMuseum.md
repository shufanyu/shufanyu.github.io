#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The necessary condition of successful VR museum learning via fsQCA <img src="/images/icons/VRicon.png"  width="20" height="20">

This study aimed to investigate how the autonomy of VRLE and learner characteristics affect learning in the VRLE. We did a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and discovered that VRLE is not good for all students but only for those with particular features.

The pilot study has been awarded as the best paper of iLRN 2022.

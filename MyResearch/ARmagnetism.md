#### Magnetism learning <img src="/images/icons/ARicon.png"  width="25" height="25">
In this research, we utilized AR technology to create a magnetism experiment that supports junior high school students physics learning. <u>Students can not only feel the repulsion and attraction between two poles, but also observe the changes of the magnetic induction lines in real time</u>.

**We conducted two experiments:**

In **[study 1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcal.12513){:target="blank"}**. We compared the effects of AR, 3D, and traditional experiments. The results showed that students in AR group outperformed those in other groups, and they presented the least cognitive load.

In **[study 2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10494820.2022.2057547){:target="blank"}**. We focused on students' learning anxiety, and conducted an 2(AR & non-AR)*2(low & high physics anxiety) experiment to investigate the .

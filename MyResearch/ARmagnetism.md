#### 2️⃣ Magnetism learning <img src="/images/icons/ARicon.png"  width="20" height="20">
In this research, we proposed an AR-based magnetism experiment to support junior high school students physics learning. <u><font color="#A13232">Students can not only feel the repulsion and attraction between two magnetic poles, but can also observe the changes in the magnetic field lines in real time.</font></u>.

**<u>We conducted two experiments:</u>**

In **[study 1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcal.12513){:target="blank"}**. We compared the effects of AR, 3D, and traditional magnetism experiments. The results showed that students in AR group outperformed those in other groups and presented the least cognitive load.

In **[study 2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10494820.2022.2057547){:target="blank"}**. We focused on students' physics learning anxiety and conducted a 2(AR & non-AR)*2(low & high physics anxiety) experiment to investigate their effects on students' learning. Results showed that AR can significantly motivate students with high anxiety, all students hold a positive attitude towards MagAR.

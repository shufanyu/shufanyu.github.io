#### 4️⃣ Doppler effect simulation <img src="/images/icons/ARicon.png"  width="20" height="20">

In this research, we developed an AR-based Doppler effect learning application titled as "DopplerAR". With the DopplerAR, students can autonomously conduct the experiment by <u><font color="#A13232">setting up the position, direction, and initial speed of the sound source (vehicles) and the observer (kid)</font></u>. Additionally, they can emulate the relative movement between the sound source and observer by moving the AR markers with their hands. 

A experiment was conducted to investigate the educational benefits of DopplerAR by comparing with a traditional 2D simulation.<u><font color="#A13232">The results revealed that students in the AR group outperformed those in the 2D group in terms of their learning achievement and interest. Both groups showed positive attitude toward the Doppler class and physics learning. Moreover, students presented a high level of cognitive perception toward the AR learning tool. </font></u>

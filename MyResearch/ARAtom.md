#### 5️⃣ The structure of molecule <img src="/images/icons/ARicon.png"  width="20" height="20">

In this research, we introduced an AR-based atom experiment to enhance junior high school students' understanding of chemistry. <u><font color="#A13232">Students can use AR markers to visualize atoms, combine them to form molecules, and ultimately create representations of real substances (e.g., water).</font></u> This application was developed in accordance with Johnstone's (1993) three levels of chemical representation.

We conducted a quasi-experiment in a junior high school to compare its effectiveness with traditional experiments. The learning activities were designed based on Kolb’s (1984) experiential learning cycle. The results indicate that the **AR application significantly increased students' knowledge transfer. Students also demonstrated heightened motivation and a high perception of the utility of the AR tool**.

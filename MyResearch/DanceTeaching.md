#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tujia Hand waving dance teaching <img src="/images/icons/kinect.png"  width="20" height="20">

In this research, we developed a Tujia (a chinese minority) Hand-waving dance teaching system üíÉbased on Kinect. <font color="#A13232">The system can evaluate students' performance in real time based on proposed algorithm. I was mainly in charge of the system development.</font>

We also conducted a quasi-experiment among university students.the results showed
that the participants who used the system demonstrated significantly
better performance and higher learning satisfaction than those who used the traditional video-instructed approach.
